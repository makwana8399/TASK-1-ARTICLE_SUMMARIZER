Harshad Mehta was a prominent stockbroker who became a household name in India during the early 1990s. 
Often referred to as the ‚ÄúBig Bull‚Äù of Dalal Street, he played a central role in one of the biggest financial scandals in Indian history. 
His story is one of ambition, innovation, and ultimately, controversy.
Mehta started his career in humble surroundings, working various odd jobs before entering the stock market. 
His deep understanding of the market and his confident demeanor helped him gain trust and build a large network of clients.
